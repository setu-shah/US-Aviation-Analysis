### Collaborators: Santiago Mazzei, Sneha Ekka, Tiancheng Yang, Varun Kaza, Victor Floriano

According to AirHelp (2023), the economic impact of air travel disruptions is estimated to be $67.5 billion globally, half of which is borne by airlines and passengers in the US alone. However, there are rising concerns about the reliability and punctuality of the aviation industry in the US, so conducting an analysis of flight delays and cancellations is essential to enhance air travel efficiency and passenger satisfaction. We will first comprehensively analyze the civil aviation industry from the national perspective before moving to a specific focus on Boston. This analysis aims to understand trends, challenges, and opportunities for optimizing air travel for airlines and passengers alike.

We will evaluate US commercial flight delays and cancellations in 2015 by airline, airport, and route. We will focus on the following aspects:

- Identify the most and least reliable airlines in terms of on-time departures
- Analyze overall flight delays/cancellations variations over time (month, day, and hour)
- Identify the airports and routes with the highest average delays
- Investigate the most common reasons for delays/cancellations and evaluate their trends over time
